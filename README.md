# Growers Challenge

## Overview
This repo has the goal to solve a challenge that I had to do and the assignment was:

### Basic Requirement
1. Create data structures that represent the following concepts:
   - A ​grower​ (a.k.a. farmer) that has a name and owns zero, one, or more ​farms​.
   - A ​farm​ has zero, one, or more ​planting events​..
   - A ​planting event​ has a date and a ​crop type​ that was planted on that date.
   - A ​crop type​ can be corn or soybeans.
2. Write a function to list the names of every grower that has planted a specific crop type this year.
3. Write one or more unit tests to verify the above function works as expected. Try to think of valuable cases to test for.
### Bonus questions:
4. Sort the grower name results of the function so that growers that have planted more recently are ordered earlier.
5. How would you optimize the code so that the function will perform better?


## Setup
Clone this repo wherever you want and just run the following command inside the project
```bash
npm install
```

## Resolve the challenge
Just run
```bash
npm start
```

## Run tests
I have written some test using Jest. You can run it using
```bash
npm run test
```

## Contributing
I'm pretty sure that this challenge could resolve with a better approach, maybe using some kind of tree. So if you want to improve my solution or maybe you found a bug, please feel free to push a PR or create an issue.
